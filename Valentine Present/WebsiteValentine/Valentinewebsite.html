    <div id="hiddenDiv2" style="display: none;">
        <h2 class="Titel">My feelings for you</h2>
        <p class="Text">I love you so much, Mai. I'm writing this because I want to do a little extra. I am kinda stuffed for time right now,<br> but I hope this is the last button you clicked.<br>

            Anyways, besides doing a little extra, this is also because I want to make my feelings more clear to you.<br> I love you so much, Mai, and I'm really happy that you're in my life.<br> You've made it so much better, and you always inspire me to do everything I can.<br> Heck, I may have forgotten about working out if you weren't in my life (I want to look the best I can for you).<br>
            
            I love how you always make me laugh and how you always know how to make me feel better when I'm down.<br> I love how you always support me and how you always believe in me.<br> You are obviously the love of my life, and I would fight the whole world if you wanted me to prove it.<br>
            
            Oh yeah, I forgot to say another thing I also love about you—of course,<br> its about how you always say "proof" in that cute voice.
            
            But anyways,<br> right now, I'm really nervous, wondering if you will like this gift.<br> I manipulated you into thinking I wasn't making a website. After all,<br> I thought of another idea to make a waffle-related game, but I knew I wouldn't have the time.<br>
            
            You know, Mai, the day I had that first late-night conversation with you,<br> I did think about dating you, but I wouldn't say I was in love with you.<br> I was just thinking that you would be a good girlfriend, to be honest.<br> I was really dumb back then, playing with your heart for fun before we started dating,<br> of course, with the playboy stuff, you know.<br>
            
            But when you sent me that picture, all of that went out of the window.<br> Instead of doing it for entertainment, I did it because I wanted you so badly.<br> I wanted to make you happy, no matter what anybody said about it.<br> Jeffrey already called me a pedophile for dating a 14-year-old, by the way, but I don't care.<br> I think you're way more mature than every 14-year-old.
            
            Yesterday, Luis, Iwan (one of my other friends in a different class), and I were biking home together,<br> and some random kids that looked 13/14 were asking if we had a valentine.<br> I said yes, Iwan also said yes and then pointed out that Luis didn't to the kids.<br> Then the kids said Luis' mother was their valentine. It was funny as hell.<br> Luis clapped back after that.
            
            But you see what I mean? You're definitely way more mature than every 14-year-old.<br> I'm so happy I met somebody like you in my life. When I was at one of my lowest moments,<br> you were definitely the light in my life. Without you, I don't know what would've happened.<br>
            
            I'm really happy you always support me and even want to help with the sprites for my future game—really. Thank you so much, Mai, for being there for me.<br>
            
            I love you so much it took so long to code this all. I hope you enjoyed this gift. Call me, will you?<br>
